# üéÆ My Small Games Collection

Welcome to my personal arcade! This repository is a fun space dedicated to showcasing a variety of small game projects I've developed. From text-based command-line games to simple graphical applications, this collection highlights my learning and experimentation in game development.

## üéØ **Purpose of This Repository:**

* **Showcasing Projects:** To gather and display my completed small game projects in one central location.
* **Skill Application:** To demonstrate my programming skills in different languages and paradigms through engaging game mechanics.
* **Learning & Fun:** To share my passion for coding by building interactive and enjoyable experiences.
* **Public Documentation:** To serve as a public record of my creative coding endeavors.

## üïπÔ∏è **What You'll Find Here:**

This repository contains a mix of games, which might include:

* **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Games:** Text-based games played directly in the terminal (e.g., guessing games, simple puzzles).
* **Graphical Games:** Games with visual elements, often built using libraries or frameworks.
* **Various Languages:** Projects might be implemented in Python, C++, Java, or other languages as I explore.

## üìÅ **Repository Structure:**

Each game project resides in its own dedicated folder, named after the game (e.g., `Hangman`, `TicTacToe`, `SimplePlatformer`). Inside each game's folder, you'll usually find:

* **`README.md`:** A brief description of the game, how to run it, and its features.
* **Source Code Files:** The actual game code.
* **Assets** (if applicable): Images, sounds, or other resources.
